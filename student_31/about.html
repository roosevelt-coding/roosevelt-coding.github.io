  <h1> About Me </h1>
  <h2> Hello, my name is Aram Arzumanyan. I founded this company when I was just 6 years old in 2012. I was born in 2006 the year after that i started to think about the future and what I am going to be when I grow up. At this point I started to go to school and I hated it because of all of the annoying kids and all the ones that would start doing bad things (hint hint) in the restrooms. But that was what inspired me to becaome a succesful business man. And then My friend asked me if we should colaborate and continue running this business. I said no because he had been a bad friend in grade school in my childhood.</h1>
